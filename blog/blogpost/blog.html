                <p>Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub—the largest
                    and most advanced development platform in the world.</p>

                <p>
                    GitHub CEO Nat Friedman is stepping down from his role on November 15 to become the Chairman
                    Emeritus of the Microsoft-owned service. Thomas Dohmke, who only recently became GitHub’s chief
                    product officer, will step into the CEO role.

                    When Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, there was quite a bit of worry in the developer community
                    that it would be an overbearing presence and turn the code sharing and collaboration service into a
                    Microsoft-first platform. With Friedman, who thanks to his developer and open source background
                    brought a lot of community goodwill with him when he took the job, GitHub remained independent and
                    platform-neutral during his three-year tenure.
