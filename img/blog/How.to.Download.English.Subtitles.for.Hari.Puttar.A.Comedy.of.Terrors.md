## Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors Movie Review
 
Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors is a movie that tries to be a funny and family-friendly version of Home Alone, but fails miserably. The movie has a weak plot, poor direction, lame jokes, and over-the-top acting. The movie does not have any connection to Harry Potter, except for the title that sounds like a cheap imitation.
 
The movie revolves around Hari Prasad Dhoonda (Aditya Kapadia), a 10-year-old boy who is nicknamed Hari Puttar by his parents. His father (Rez Kempton) is a scientist who has invented a secret chip that can control any satellite in the world. His family moves to England, where they live in a huge mansion. Hari feels lonely and neglected by his parents and his cousins, who are more interested in playing video games and watching TV. The only person who befriends him is his cousin Tuk Tuk (Swini Khara), who suffers from asthma.
 
One day, Hari's parents leave for a conference, leaving him and Tuk Tuk alone in the house. Meanwhile, two thieves named Diesel (Saurabh Shukla) and Filter (Vijay Raaz) are hired by an evil businessman named DK (Jackie Shroff) to steal the chip from Hari's father. They break into the house and try to find the chip, but they are unaware that Hari and Tuk Tuk are inside. Hari and Tuk Tuk use their wit and creativity to set up various traps and pranks to stop the thieves and save the day.
 
The movie is supposed to be a comedy of terrors, but it is neither funny nor scary. The movie relies on slapstick humor and clichÃ©d gags that are neither original nor amusing. The movie also has some illogical and unrealistic scenes that defy common sense. For example, Hari manages to hack into a satellite system with his laptop and use it to spy on the thieves. He also uses a remote-controlled helicopter to drop eggs on them. The thieves are so dumb that they fall for every trick that Hari plays on them.
 
The movie also lacks any charm or emotion that could make the audience care for the characters. The movie does not explore the relationship between Hari and his family or his friends. The movie does not show any growth or change in Hari's personality or attitude. He remains a smart-alecky kid who likes to play pranks on others. The movie also does not have any message or moral for the viewers.
 
The movie wastes the talent of some good actors like Jackie Shroff, Saurabh Shukla, Vijay Raaz, and Lilette Dubey. They are reduced to caricatures who ham their way through their roles. The child actors are also annoying and unconvincing in their performances.
 
Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors is a movie that should be avoided by anyone who likes good cinema. It is a boring and irritating movie that does not entertain or educate anyone.
